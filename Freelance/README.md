```


### 2. Uninstall globally installed dependencies (if any)

If you installed anything globally (optional), you can remove it like this:

```bash
npm uninstall -g hardhat
```

### 3. (Optional) Clear local node modules and lock file first

If you want to clean up without deleting the repo folder:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The smart contracts provided in this repository are simplified examples created for educational and demonstration purposes only. They are designed to run on a local blockchain node and are not intended for deployment to mainnet or handling real funds. Please do not use these contracts as-is in production environments. If you wish to experiment with smart contracts, always do so on a testnet and perform thorough testing and audits before considering any real-world use.
